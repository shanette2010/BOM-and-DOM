When working with web development, two essential concepts are the Browser Object Model (BOM) and the Document Object Model (DOM).


# Browser Object Model (BOM):
The Browser Object Model (BOM) represents everything that is provided by the web browser as an object. 
It includes objects like the window, navigator, screen, history, and location. 
  1. Window Object: The window object represents the browser window. It acts as the global object for JavaScript code running within the browser window and provides access to various browser features.
  2. Navigator Object: The navigator object provides information about the browser itself, such as its name, version, and platform.
  3. Screen Object: The screen object represents the user's screen and provides information about its size and pixel depth.
  4. History Object: The history object allows manipulation of the browser's session history, enabling navigation backward and forward through the user's browsing history.
  5. Location Object: The location object contains information about the current URL and provides methods for navigating to different URLs.


# Document Object Model (DOM):
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. 
  1. Nodes: The DOM represents the document as a hierarchical tree of nodes. Each node corresponds to an element, attribute, or text within the document.
  2. Elements: Element nodes represent HTML elements in the document. They can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript to change their attributes, content, or style.
  3. Attributes: Attribute nodes represent the attributes of HTML elements. They can be accessed and modified to change the behavior or appearance of elements.
  4. Methods and Properties: The DOM provides methods and properties for interacting with document elements. These include methods for traversing the DOM tree, manipulating elements, handling events, and accessing element attributes.
